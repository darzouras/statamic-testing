# Statamic POC and Experiments

This repository is the outcome of my attempt to build a website using [Statamic](https://statamic.com).

## Getting Started
Getting the environment set up so far has been the trickiest part of this:

Important links:
- [Statamic installation docs](https://docs.statamic.com/installing)
- Mac only, my preferred method of serving: [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/valet)
- Definitely need if using Laravel Valet: [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Note: I was unable to get the Statamic demo working with PHP 7.3 installed due to a bug (I forgot the name). PHP 7.1 seems to be running smoothly, so when going through the Laravel Valet install process I install PHP 7.1 specifically with `brew istall php@7.1`
